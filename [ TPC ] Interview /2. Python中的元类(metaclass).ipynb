For example, suppose you're building an ORM to access a database, and you want records from each table to be of a class mapped to that table (based on fields, business rules, etc..,), a possible use of metaclass is for instance, connection pool logic, which is share by all classes of record from all tables. Another use is logic to to support foreign keys, which involves multiple classes of records.  \n",
